Product design is a complex calculating process which must consider experts¡¯ knowledge and market demands. The product design process generally includes: the Project Identified, the Conceptual Design, the Embodiment Design and the Product Service. For the process, the Conceptual design determines the approximate architecture, functionalities, and the product costs of a product. The cost of modifying a product is typically small during the conceptual design phase, but the more the product is modified in the later stages of product design, the greater the cost [1]. Conceptual Design is a series of organized, targeted and orderly design activities that analyze the user's needs and generate concept products. It manifests from the abstract to concrete, from coarse to fine, from fuzzy to clear, while the conceptual design is also the first step in the designer's transition from concept to a product's initial model.
